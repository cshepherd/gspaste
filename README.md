65816 source code examples to read and write Apple IIGS SHR screen using Wiznet 5100 chip (as found in Uthernet II) in TCP offloading mode

Current status
- sendshr.s is believed to be exactly correct - listener.py receives the exact contents of SHR RAM
- recvshr.s is believed to be exactly correct - sender.py sends a full SHR screen and it gets put at E1/2000

TODO
- fix that which is broke

HAVE A NICE DAY
